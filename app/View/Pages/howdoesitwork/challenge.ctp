    <h1>The Challenge</h1>
    <p class="normaltext">Every year, Design for Change World hosts the <a href=”http://btc.dfcworld.com/”>Be the Change Conference</a>, where teams of youth from across the world share the change they've created. It's a two-day celebration of young people's accomplishments, and a powerful reminder of what we can achieve when we work together. Presenters and interactive workshops share the best and brightest ideas from around the world -- and of course there's plenty of time for music, fun and games, too.</p>
    <br/>
    <p class="normaltext">The last conference was in September 2014 at the National Institute of Design in Ahmedabad, India.</p>

    <p class="normaltext">Every year, Design for Change USA sponsors one team from the U.S. to travel to the conference and present to the worldwide Design for Change community, sharing their achievements and exchanging inspiration. The representative team is chosen by a panel of impartial evaluators, based on the project that team's mentor submits to DFC USA. We're thrilled to be able to offer this opportunity (although we wish we could send every team).</p>
